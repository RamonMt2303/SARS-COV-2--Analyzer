#Introduction to the problem
At the end of 2019, the city of Wuhan, in Hubei province (a Chinese city with more than 11 million inhabitants), became the center of a pneumonia epidemic of unknown cause with global implications.

Serological tests are known to be a very useful tool for confirming infection by a pathogen in the population and, combined with epidemiological and clinical data, allow the severity and transmissibility of the pathogen to be estimated and the population groups that have been infected to be identified. as well as those who remain susceptible. For this reason, we increasingly require molecular data such as the nucleic acid sequences of viruses to know their origin and epidemiological potential.

#Development
To develop this problem, first we 
This work was made using R language for DNA and RNA analysis and find similarities and differences between different nucleotide strings
